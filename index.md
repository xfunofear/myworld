# 🧠Technical IT & Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio — a collection of hands-on security assessments, vulnerability scans, defensive audits 
and Helpdesk operations and incident handling.
This site showcases the tools and technologies I’m comfortable using across both IT support and cybersecurity 
— from system utilities and scripting languages to security testing and endpoint protection platforms.
